# The genuinein DID Method Specification

**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Abstract

The `did:genuinein` method is a decentralized identifier system that enables verifiable, self-sovereign digital identity managed on the GenuineIN platform. This method is designed to be resolvable via a secure and trusted RESTful API, providing a straightforward path for individuals and organizations to create, manage, and present W3C-compliant Verifiable Credentials. It is a "centralized" DID method in that the GenuineIN platform acts as the trusted ledger for DID Documents.

## 2. Method-Specific Identifier (MSI) Syntax

The `did:genuinein` identifier conforms to the `did-core` generic DID syntax.

`did:genuinein:<unique-identifier>`

The `unique-identifier` is a case-sensitive, URL-safe Base64URL-encoded string generated by the GenuineIN platform upon registration. It does not contain any personally identifiable information.

**Example:**
`did:genuinein:zR9iC3tX-7b8E2fG_JkLpQ`

## 3. CRUD Operation Definitions

All CRUD operations are performed via HTTPS requests to the GenuineIN platform's DID API endpoint: `https://api.genuinein.com/v1/dids/`

### 3.1 Create (Register)

A new `did:genuinein` is created by an authenticated user on the GenuineIN platform.

* **Endpoint:** `POST /v1/dids/`
* **Authentication:** The request must be authenticated using a bearer token obtained by the user upon logging into the GenuineIN platform.
* **Request Body:** The request body must include the initial public key material for the DID Document's `authentication` verification method.

    ```json
    {
      "publicKeyJwk": {
        "kty": "OKP",
        "crv": "Ed25519",
        "x": "VCpo2LMLhn6iWku8MKvSLg2ZAoC-nlOy-V24_1F2yBc"
      }
    }
    ```

* **Response:** The server returns a `201 Created` status with the full DID and its initial DID Document.

### 3.2 Read (Resolve)

Resolving a `did:genuinein` identifier is a public, unauthenticated operation.

* **Endpoint:** `GET /v1/dids/{unique-identifier}`
* **Request:** An HTTP GET request is made to the resolver endpoint, appending the unique identifier.
    * **Example Request:** `GET https://api.genuinein.com/v1/dids/zR9iC3tX-7b8E2fG_JkLpQ`
* **Response:** The server returns a `200 OK` with a JSON object containing the DID Document, conforming to the W3C DID Core specification.

### 3.3 Update

Updating a DID Document requires the DID controller to prove ownership by signing the request.

* **Endpoint:** `PUT /v1/dids/{unique-identifier}`
* **Authentication:** The request must be authenticated with a digital signature. The `Authorization` header must contain a signature created by one of the keys listed in the `authentication` method of the *current* DID Document.
* **Request Body:** The request body contains the new, complete DID Document.
* **Response:** The server returns a `200 OK` with the updated DID Document.

### 3.4 Deactivate (Revoke)

Deactivating a DID is an irreversible operation.

* **Endpoint:** `DELETE /v1/dids/{unique-identifier}`
* **Authentication:** The request must be authenticated with a digital signature, identical to the Update operation.
* **Response:** The server returns a `204 No Content`.
* **Resolution after Deactivation:** Attempting to resolve a deactivated DID will result in a `410 Gone` status, with a response body indicating the DID has been deactivated.

## 4. Security Considerations

* **Transport Security:** All API endpoints must be protected with TLS 1.2 or higher.
* **Authentication:** State-changing operations (Create, Update, Deactivate) are protected by bearer tokens or digital signatures, ensuring only the DID controller can make changes.
* **Key Management:** Users are responsible for securely managing their private keys. The GenuineIN platform only ever stores public keys.
* **DID Document Integrity:** The DID Document returned by the resolver is the single source of truth. Its integrity is maintained by the security of the GenuineIN platform.

## 5. Privacy Considerations

* **No Personal Data in DID:** The `did:genuinein` identifier itself is an opaque string and contains no personal information.
* **Data Minimization:** The DID Document only contains public keys and service endpoints necessary for cryptographic verification and interaction. It does not contain PII.
* **Selective Disclosure:** Verifiable Credentials issued to a `did:genuinein` allow for selective disclosure of claims, giving the user control over their data.
* **Resolution Privacy:** While DID resolution is public, the GenuineIN platform does not log resolution requests to correlate DID lookups with user activity.
